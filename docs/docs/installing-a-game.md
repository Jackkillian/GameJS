# Installing a Game
1. Put the downloaded GJS file into the __Games__ folder
2. Launch GameJS. You should see the game there.  

If you don't see the game,
- make sure the file has the extension `.gjs`
- the game could be broken. Try changing the extension to `.zip`. Then open the archive. There should be two things:  

`config.json` (file)  
`files` (folder)  

If there is only one directory, open it and try zipping the contents. Then put that file into the __Games__ directory with the extension `.gjs`.
